Running code in RPROJECT will lead to 8 things being created. right_primary_final, left_primary_final, right_secondaries_final, left_secondaries_final are all files containing the models' conclusions on all pitches thrown in 2022. righty_secondary_model, lefty_secondary_model, righty_primary_model, and lefty_primary_model are all the models used, which can be used again on data in a similar format as to what is entered in the code. For the primary models, this would be velo,X,Y,Z,HB,IVB,SSW, and for the secondaries models this would be velo,X,Y,Z,HB,IVB,SSW,d,dmovez,dmovex,dvelo,pitches. For deeper explainations of these variables, please consult the Tunneling article linked int he github. Note that the code can take several hours to run in full.
